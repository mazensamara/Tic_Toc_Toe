#Implementation of Two Player Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python on Raspberry PI.
# for using a membrane keypad with the Raspberry Pi to play Tic-Tac-Toe

''' We will make the board using dictionary 
    in which keys will be the location(i.e : top-left,mid-right,etc.)
    and initialliy it's values will be empty space and then after every move 
    we will change the value according to player's choice of move.
